# Arithmetic Expression Manipulation Library ![](https://github.com/maxplush/lark-arithmetic/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

A simple python library for manipulating arithmetic expressions. With added functional /, %, **, minifying and an infinix RPN converter!


This simple Python library provides utilities for manipulating arithmetic expressions. It includes the following features:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- **Advanced Operations**: Support for exponentiation (`**`), modulus (`%`), and more.
- **Expression Minification**: Minify expressions to reduce their length and complexity.
- **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Converter**: Convert arithmetic expressions to RPN (postfix) format for easier computation.
